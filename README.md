I code primarily in Python and have kept the majority of my work on here AFTER I recently learned to use it. I enjoy spending my time on difficult coding puzzles as I feel the most growth while I widen my repotorie :)

Things not shown here include the code for a small game I had been working on before my PC corrupted
